Personal Projects that I'm working on


Welcome to my personal projects repository on GitHub! This branch contains a collection of projects that I have worked on for personal learning and development.

Project List
Here's a brief overview of the projects in this branch:

Project A: A simple Linked list in java made for practice.

Project B: A WordHunt solver I made overnight, to give people a chance at beating me.


Thank you for taking the time to check out my personal projects repository. I hope you find something here that interests you!
